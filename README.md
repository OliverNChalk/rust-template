# Rust Template

This repo contains a standard rust app template. It imports some opinionated
libraries that you might not need, most notably `tokio` as an async runtime and
`clap` to parse command-line arguments.

## Getting started

- Configure `Cargo.toml`.
- Search for "rust-template" & replace as appropriate.
